The Scientific Python ecosystem is a loose federation of community developed
and owned Python projects widely used in scientific research, technical
computing, and data science. This blog is part of the Scientific Python
project, which aims to better coordinate the ecosystem and grow the community.

## Community

Healthy communities are built when everyone's voice is heard,
when their perspective is valued, and when their work is recognized.
Better technical and social solutions can be found through wide participation.
We are therefore dedicated to expanding our community in a welcoming and inclusive way,
with particular focus on increased participation by people who identify with groups that are
underrepresented in STEM and the open source scientific Python community.

Community members must adhere to our
[code of conduct](https://scientific-python.org/code_of_conduct/).
