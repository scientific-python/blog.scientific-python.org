# Abstract

The Scientific Python Blog is a consensus-based community project.

## Decision Making Process

The Editors use a _consensus seeking_ process for making decisions.
The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among community managers.
Editors are expected to distinguish between fundamental objections to a proposal and minor
perceived flaws that they can live with, and not hold up the decision making process for the latter.
If no option can be found without an objection, the decision is escalated to the Editor-in-Chief.
