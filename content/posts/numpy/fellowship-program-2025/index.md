The NumPy team is excited to announce the appointment of Joren Hammudoglu (@jorenham) as the second NumPy Developer in Residence. For the second time, the project is in a position to use its project funds to pay for a full year of maintainer time through the NumPy Fellowship Program.

Joren has been the driving force behind the improvements in NumPy's support for static typing since he started contributing in mid-2024. He has authored a lot of the improvements — from the annotations themselves to CI support and working towards fundamental design improvements like ndarray shape typing — and helps guide and integrate the work of other NumPy contributors in this area, and engages with upstream projects like MyPy and Pyright and the typing standards/PEP process to help move static typing support for the ecosystem as a whole forward. He also contributes widely to static typing support in the ecosystem, as the author of `scipy-stubs`, `numtype` and more.

The NumPy Steering Council sees Joren’s appointment to this role as both recognition of his contributions and expertise as well as an opportunity to continue improving NumPy’s static typing support — an area that few maintainers are knowledgeable about but a significant fraction of end users tends to care about a lot.

Joren's role is for the calendar year 2025. Thanks to individual and corporate donations, as well as payments from Tidelift, NumPy has been able to fund another full-time position for one year, following the first such role held by Sayed Adel in 2023. The funds are still [transparently administered](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0048-spending-project-funds.html) on Open Collective.

Welcome aboard, Joren! We're excited to see the impact of your work.
