As has been discussed in detail in Nadia Eghbal's [Roads and Bridges](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/), the CZI EOSS [program
announcement](https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/), and in the NumFocus [sustainability program goals](https://numfocus.org/programs/sustainability), much of the critical software that science and industry are built on
is maintained by a primarily volunteer community. While this has worked, it is not sustainable in the long term for the health of many
projects or their contributors.

We are happy to announce that we have hired Elliott Sales de Andrade ([QuLogic](https://github.com/QuLogic))
as the [Matplotlib Software Research Engineering
Fellow](https://github.com/matplotlib/CZI_2019-07_mpl) supported by
the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for
Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/matplotlib-foundation-of-scientific-visualization-in-python/)
effective March 1, 2020!

Elliott has been contributing to a broad variety of Free and Open
Source projects for several years. He is an active Matplotlib
contributor and has had commit rights since October 2015. In addition
to working on Matplotlib, Elliott has contributed to a wide range of
projects in the Scientific Python software stack, both downstream and
upstream of Matplotlib, including
[Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/),
[ObsPy](https://obspy.org/), and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). Outside
of Python, Elliott is a developer on the [Pidgin
project](https://pidgin.im/) and a packager for [Fedora
Linux](https://getfedora.org/). In his work on Matplotlib, he is interested in advancing
science through reproducible workflows and more accessible libraries.

We are already seeing a reduction in the backlog of open issues and
pull requests, which we hope will make the library easier to
contribute to and maintain long term. We also benefit from Elliott
having the bandwidth to maintain a library wide view of all the
on-going work and open bugs. Hiring Elliott as an RSEF is the
start of ensuring that Matplotlib is sustainable in the long term.

Looking forward to all the good work we are going to do this year!
