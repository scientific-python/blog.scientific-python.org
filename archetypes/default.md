Some cool description before jumping in maybe?

## New cool Post

[Link](https://blog.scientific-python.org).

Here is some code

```python
import numpy as np

...
```

And maybe you need inline maths like $A=\pi r^2$, or more prominent equations:

$$ \sum_0^1 x $$

### Images

Images must be in PNG and compressed using a tool like `pngcrush` or
`pngquant`. For instance:

```bash
pngquant --ext .png --force my_figure.png
```

Another important aspect is alt-text. All figures must include alt-text.
This is very important for inclusiveness.
